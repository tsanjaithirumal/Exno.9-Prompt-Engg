## üéØ Aim

To perform the exploration of prompting techniques for video generation using AI models. This involves designing and refining text prompts to create video content such as animations, cinematic scenes, visual effects, or video summaries.

---

## üìã Algorithm

1. Select an AI-based video generation model or tool.
2. Begin with simple, general prompts.
3. Gradually refine prompts with detailed elements like lighting, mood, characters, motion, and camera angles.
4. Experiment with different video styles (e.g., animation, cinematic, artistic).
5. Analyze and iterate to improve output.
6. Save and compare multiple versions of generated videos.
7. Document how prompt structure affects output quality and relevance.

## üîß Procedure

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Familiarize Yourself with AI Video Tools

Explore and understand available AI tools for video generation:

- üé• Runway ML (Gen-2)  
- ü§ñ Synthesia  
- üéûÔ∏è Pictory  
- üß† DeepBrain  
- üìΩÔ∏è Kaiber  
- üé® Sora by OpenAI (if available)

> üìå Note: Understand their capabilities and limitations before generating content.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Simple Prompts

Start with basic prompt structures:
```
"A person walking in a park."
```

‚úÖ Outcome: A basic animated or realistic video of someone walking.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Experiment with Detailed Prompts

Add more specific elements:
```
"A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path, with birds flying in the sky, and a dog running beside them."
```

‚úÖ Outcome: A more visually rich and context-aware video with detailed scenery and characters.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Incorporate Time and Motion Elements

Add motion descriptions or transitions:
```
"A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out from a beach, capturing the waves and changing colors in the sky."
```

‚úÖ Outcome: Time-driven motion with smooth transitions and environmental change.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Try Different Video Styles

Test variations like cinematic, animated, or surreal art:
```
"An animated scene of a futuristic city at night, with glowing neon lights, flying cars, and a bustling crowd of people."
```

‚úÖ Outcome: Stylized, genre-specific visuals depending on the tool‚Äôs capabilities.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Refine with Camera Direction

Add dynamic visual cues:
```
"A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night, with reflections on the wet street and a high-speed chase scene."
```

‚úÖ Outcome: Higher quality output with depth, movement, and drama.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Multiple Versions

Use slightly different wordings:
```
- "A spaceship flying through a starfield."
- "A detailed cinematic view of a spaceship navigating through asteroid fields in space."
```

Compare how prompt specificity changes output style, resolution, and dynamics.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Save and Analyze Outputs

Store and compare generated videos:

| Prompt Version | Style       | Motion Quality | Visual Detail | Notes                     |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Simple         | Basic       | Low            | Minimal        | Lacks depth and movement   |
| Refined        | Cinematic   | High           | High           | More immersive and clear   |

---

## ‚úÖ Result

The experiment on video prompt engineering was executed successfully. Prompts with higher detail, emotion, and scene guidance generated significantly more refined and realistic video outputs.
